# Loan Repayment Prediction using Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to predict loan repayment status using machine learning models, specifically the Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier. The dataset contains various features such as credit scores, loan amounts, and payment histories. The goal is to classify whether a loan will be fully paid or not based on these features. We demonstrate how both models perform on this binary classification task and compare their accuracy and efficiency.

## Methods
 - Data Exploration: The dataset is first analyzed using visualizations like histograms and count plots to understand the relationships between features and the target variable (loan repayment status).

 - Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and transformed by encoding categorical variables and handling missing values, ensuring the models are trained on well-structured and consistent data.
 
 - Model Training: The Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier algorithms are applied to train the model. We evaluate both models with the training data and adjust hyperparameters like the number of estimators for Random Forest.

 - Model Evaluation: The performance of both models is assessed using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. We compare the results to determine which model performs best for predicting loan repayment status.

This project highlights how decision trees and random forests can be used for predicting financial outcomes, helping in decision-making for lenders and financial institutions.
